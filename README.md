####JavaScript Quick Reference

JavaScript can be run in all modern web browsers without additional software installation.

You should be familiar with the following JavaScript types.

---
#####Variable [[?]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)
  A variable is a named container that holds any type of value or object.  Variables are declared using the keyword var.
```javascript
var myNumber = 2 + 3;
~ myNumber returns 5
```


---
#####Comparison
Comparisons are used to compare values with eachother.

Symbol | Meaning
:----:|----
`===` | equal to
`!==` | not equal to
`<` | less than
`<=` | less than or equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
```javascript
~ 10 === 10 returns true  
~ "left" !== "right" returns true  
~ 9 <= 2 returns false  
~ 3 > 3 returns false   
~ 3 >= 3 returns true
```

---
#####Logic
Logical operators determine logic between values.
```javascript
&& - and
|| - or
! - not
```
* true && false returns false
* true || false returns true
* !true returns false


#####String 
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, used for textual information.  String properties or methods you may need to use include .length, .split() or .substr().
```javascript
var myString = "Hello Worf!";
```
* `myString.length` returns `11`
* `myString.substr(0,4)` returns `"Hell"`
* `myString.substr(2,5)` returns `"llo W"`
* `myString.substr(2)` returns `"llo Worf!"`
* `myString.split("o")` returns `["Hell","W","rf!"]`


#####Boolean 
A boolean is a type that represents true or false.  Booleans are typed without quotes, and are the standard return type of comparisons.
```javascript
var isFourMoreThanThree = 4 > 3;
var canPigsSwim = true;
var canPigsFly = false;
var doPigsMakeGoodSeaplanes = canPigsFly && canPigsSwim;
```
* `isFourMoreThanThree` returns `true`
* `doPigsMakeGoodSeaplanes` returns `false`


#####Array 
An array is an ordered list of elements, enclosed with square brackets, seperated by commas.  These elements can be anything from numbers or strings to objects or more arrays.  JavaScript supports arrays with multiple lement types.
```javascript
var myArray = [1,2,"three",Math.PI,[true,false]]
```
* `myArray[0]` returns `1`
* `myArray[3]` returns `Math.PI`
* `myArray[4][1]` returns `false`


#####Function 
A function is a named block of code that is only executed when called.  Variables can be passed into a function as arguments.  A function that belongs to an object is called a method.  Functions can be assigned to variable names using the function keyword to create a lambda function.  (There are a few ways to declare functions, but this method should be learned first.)
```javascript
var addToFive = function(x) {return x+5;}
var areEqual = function(x,y) {return x===y}
```
* `addToFive(11)` returns `16`
* `areEqual("blue","yellow")` returns `false`
