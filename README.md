####JavaScript Quick Reference

JavaScript can be run in all modern web browsers without additional software installation.

You should be familiar with the following JavaScript types.

---
#####Variable [[?]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)
  A variable is a named container that holds any type of value or object.  Variables are declared using the keyword var.  It is important to remember that variable names are case-sensitive; myVar is not the same as MyVar.  Variable names are conventionally type in camelCase, but this is not a requirement of the language.  A variable declared inside a function is locally scoped; this means the variable will only be available from with the function.
```javascript
var myNumber = 2 + 3;
var ten = 10;
var firstName = "Benjamin";
var lastName = "Dover";
~ myNumber returns 5
~ myNumber * ten returns 50
~ firstName + lastName returns "BenjaminDover"
```


---
#####Comparison [[?]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
Comparisons are used to compare values with eachother.

Symbol | Meaning
:----:|----
`==` | equal to
`===` | identical to
`!=` | not equal to
`!==` | not identical to
`<` | less than
`<=` | less than or equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
```javascript
~ 10 === 10 returns true  
~ 10 === "10" returns false
~ 10 == "10" returns true
~ "left" !== "right" returns true  
~ 9 <= 2 returns false  
~ 3 > 3 returns false   
~ 3 >= 3 returns true
```

---
#####Logic [[?]] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators)
Logical operators determine logic between values.  And-operators evaluate to true when all values equal true. Or-operators evaluate to true when at least one of the values is true.  The not-operator returns the opposite of its value.

Symbol | Meaning
:---:|---
`&&` | and
`||` | or
`!` | not
```javascript
~ true && true returns true
~ true && false returns false
~ false && false returns false
~ true || true returns true
~ true || false returns true
~ false || false returns false
~ !true returns false
```
---
#####Boolean [[?]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean)
A boolean is a type that represents true or false.  Booleans are typed without quotes, and are the standard return type of comparisons.
```javascript
var isFourMoreThanThree = 4 > 3;
var canPigsSwim = true;
var canPigsFly = false;
var doPigsMakeGoodSeaplanes = canPigsFly && canPigsSwim;
~ isFourMoreThanThree returns true
~ doPigsMakeGoodSeaplanes returns false
```

---
#####String [[?]] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, used for textual information.  String properties or methods you may need to use include .length, .split() or .substr().
```javascript
var myString = "Hello Worf!";
~ myString.length returns 11
~ myString.substr(0,4) returns "Hell"
~ myString.substr(2,5) returns "llo W"
~ myString.substr(2) returns "llo Worf!"
~ myString.split("o") returns ["Hell","W","rf!"]
```
---

#####Array [[?]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
An array is an ordered list of elements, enclosed with square brackets, seperated by commas.  These elements can be anything from numbers or strings to objects or more arrays.  JavaScript supports arrays with multiple lement types.
```javascript
var myArray = [1,2,"three",Math.PI,[true,false]]
~ myArray[0] returns 1
~ myArray[3] returns Math.PI
~ myArray[4][1] returns false
```

---
#####Function [[?]]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions
A function is a named block of code that is only executed when called.  Variables can be passed into a function as arguments.  A function that belongs to an object is called a method.  Functions can be assigned to variable names using the function keyword to create a lambda function.  (There are a few ways to declare functions, but this method should be learned first.)
```javascript
var addToFive = function(x) {return x+5;}
var areEqual = function(x,y) {return x===y}
~ addToFive(11) returns 16
~ areEqual("blue","yellow") returns false
```
