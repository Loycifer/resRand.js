resRand.js is an easy-to-use JavaScript object for restricted randomization of experimental stimuli, controlled trials, or your large collection of rare porcelain clowns.










JavaScript can be run in nearly all modern web browsers without additional software installation.

You should be familiar with the following JavaScript types.

Variable - A variable is a named container that holds any type of value or object.  Variables are declared using the keyword var.
'''
var myNumber = 2 + 3;
=>myNumber returns 5
'''

Comparison - Comparisons are used to compare values with eachother.
=== - equal to
!== - not equal to
< - less than
<= - less than or equal to
> - greater than
>= - greater than or equal to
=>10 === 10 returns true
=>"left" !== right returns true
=>9 <= 2 returns false
=>3 > 3 returns false
=>3 >= 3 returns true

Logic - Logical operators determine logic between values.
&& - and
|| - or
! - not
=>true && false returns false
=>true || false returns true
=>!true returns false

String - A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, used for textual information.  String properties or methods you may need to use include .length, .split() or .substr().
var myString = "Hello Worf!";
=>myString.length returns 11
=>myString.substr(0,4) returns "Hell"
=>myString.substr(2,5) returns "llo W"
=>myString.substr(2) returns "llo Worf!"
=>myString.split("o") returns ["Hell","W","rf!"]

Boolean - A boolean is a type that represents true or false.  Booleans are typed without quotes, and are the standard return type of comparisons.
var isFourMoreThanThree = 4 > 3;
var canPigsSwim = true;
var canPigsFly = false;
var doPigsMakeGoodSeaplanes = canPigsFly && canPigsSwim;
=>isFourMoreThanThree returns true
=>doPigsMakeGoodSeaplanes returns false

Array - An array is an ordered list of elements, enclosed with square brackets, seperated by commas.  These elements can be anything from numbers or strings to objects or more arrays.  JavaScript supports arrays with multiple lement types.
var myArray = [1,2,"three",Math.PI,[true,false]]
=>myArray[0] returns 1
=>myArray[3] returns Math.PI
=>myArray[4][1] returns false

Function - A function is a named block of code that is only executed when called.  Variables can be passed into a function as arguments.  A function that belongs to an object is called a method.  Functions can be assigned to variable names using the function keyword to create a lambda function.  (There are a few ways to declare functions, but this method should be learned first.)
var addToFive = function(x) {return x+5;}
var areEqual = function(x,y) {return x===y}
=>addToFive(11) returns 16
=>areEqual("blue","yellow") returns false
